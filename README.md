# Project 0
Here we have a game of Tic Tac Toe, simple as it may be many hours of hard work and near breakdowns were put into this lovingly made little game. This project was made for the first project week at General Assembly to put to use our HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery to use and stretch our abilities.

[Here is the live site](https://calebrivers.github.io/Project0v2/)

## Technology involved
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- jQuery

## Features
- Abilities for two people to play Tic Tac Toe using the same computer.
- Shows when there is a winner on the screen.
- Shows when there is a draw on the screen.
- Reset button that resets the game board allowing the game to played over and over again.
- Player score is counted for the winner either being X or O.

## Future Improvements

- In the future I would like to add some AI to this so you are able to play against the program itself. Time limitations did not allow me to include this feature to the program in its current state.
- Multiplayer capabilities.
